Implemented the examples from the book ["Head First Design Patterns: A Brain-Friendly Guide"](https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Design-Patterns-Brain-Friendly/dp/0596007124) in ABAP.

# Strategy pattern
*The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.*
### Design principles:
- Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
- Program to an interface, not an implementation.
- Favor composition over inheritance.
